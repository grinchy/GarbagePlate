## Set Lists
Each set list below is a listing of the songs we practiced for a period of time. Each entry has links to tab, videos or other practice material and also a status, which can be one of the following:

- Learning
	- These are songs where at least one of us is still learning the parts to the song and how to play it
- Practicing
	- These are songs that we all know how to play but we are working out the details of how we want to play it together
- Polishing
	- These are songs that we all know how to play and it actually sounds good. We are still working out the finer details of things like fills, solos, etc. but the song could probably be played in front of an audience as-is
- Perfected
	- These are songs that there is no question we are ready to play in front of people
